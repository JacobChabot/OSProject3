Jacob Chabot Project 3

Major differences between Project 2:

*semaphores
*made n a required argument, master should terminate if n is not provided per Alina
*program terminates after -h
*added a error message if user input n > 20 and sets n back to the default of 20
*fixed issue with warnings from undeclared sleep function (forgot to add the library)
*added signal handling for ^C

Issues/Bugs:

Whenever you choose a larger n and the timer exceeds the given amount, the master program will start killing the children programs as asked, but sometimes will result in semget errors. In my testing the 
program doesn't terminate but the error messages show on the console.

Notes:

*Kept the printf statements whenever a process entered critical section, this helped to make sure the programs were executing correctly.
*Added a cstest file with n = 10
